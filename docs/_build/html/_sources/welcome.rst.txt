Welcome
=======

Welcome to pyhealth. This is a Python 3.x module for collecting and analyzing your health, activity tracking, sport data. The intent is to be able to set up your scripts to collect your data from SleepAsAndroid, Garmin, Suunto, Google Health, Fitbit, etc. I would also like to eventually set it up to push to those same services. This would be similar to the Tapirik service, but will pull and push activity data if available (steps, resting heart rate, sleep data, etc). This is very much a work in progress that I am playing around to teach myself how to connect to these different services.
